    "background": "#f4f4f4",//background
    "site_name": "Luminarium",//name
    "site_icon": "",//icon
    "max_file_size": 10,//max_file_size(MB)
    "allowed_extensions": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "webp"],//allowed file types
    "convert_to_webp": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg"],//automatic file types for conversion to webp
